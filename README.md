# Bojo Paint Scripts
Quickly export to TGA for photoshop painting in iRacing.

## Quick Setup Steps
1. Download the zip file from the [latest release](https://github.com/bojobiscuit/bojoPaintScripts/releases)
2. Open each script in notepad and change the number to your iRacing number - `var userNumber = "655163";`
4. Move files into your photoshop's paint folder - `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2025\Presets\Scripts`
5. Restart Photoshop
6. Set photoshop shortcuts for scripts _(optional, but recommended)_
7. Open your paint file from the car's paint folder

## Scripts
- **Save as TGA.jsx** - Creates a sim stamped paint with iRacing numbers baked onto it after
- **Save as TGA Num.jsx** - Creates a paint no numbers. Add your own custom number, or don't at all!
- **Save as TGA Spec.jsx** - Creates a spec map file. I believe iRacing needs to be open to have it create the mip file
- **Delete All.jsx** - Deletes just your paint files (tga and mip) for that car and only your car.

## Setting Photoshop shortcuts
